  	<para>The &export-graph-cmd; command appears in the file menu whenever a graph window is selected.
			All graphs, or one graph at a time, can be exported in any of the available image formats. Since
			all export options have the same image formats available, these will be described first. Depending
			upon the image format chosen, you may be able to customize some image file parameters by checking
			the <emphasis>show options</emphasis> check box. Available options vary according to the format chosen.</para>
		<para>For the <emphasis>bmp, pbm, jpeg, xbm, pgm, ppm</emphasis> image formats, the only available option
			is the quality of the image. This parameter defines the image compression ratio, and may be set to any
			value between 0 and 100%. Higher values produce a better quality image and a larger file, while lower
			values result in increasingly lossy compression, degraded image quality, and smaller file size.
			For <emphasis>png</emphasis>, <emphasis>tiff</emphasis> and <emphasis>xpm</emphasis>, there is an option
			to choose a transparent background.</para>

			is the screen resolution. If you increase the resolution, the overall size of the plot will be unchanged
			but the quality of the graphic elements will be better.</para>
		<para>By default the plot is exported to its real size on screen, but if you wish, you can choose a
			different size  by checking the <emphasis>Custom print size</emphasis> box. In addition, there is
			a <emphasis>Keep aspect ratio</emphasis> option. If you check this box and modify one dimension of
			a plot, the other dimension will automatically be modified to keep the plot's aspect ratio the same.</para>

		<para>When exporting the plot to LaTeX (.tex) there are two very useful options: <emphasis>Export font sizes
			</emphasis> and	<emphasis>Escape special characters in title/axis labels</emphasis>. If checked, the first
			option will include LaTeX commands in the output which keep the original font sizes. If not checked, the
			font size specified in the preamble of the TeX document will be used for all text strings in the plot.
			The second option specifies whether LaTeX special characters should be escaped or not when exporting. If
			the title or the axis labels contain	LaTeX syntax (like superscripts, subscripts, etc...), and you want
			them to be interpreted by the LaTeX compiler, you must uncheck this option.</para>

They just happen to be located in the same place on the graph window. In fact the inset layer can be moved anywhere on the graph window and is treated like a normal layer in every way. When the inset layer is completely contained inside another layer, it will disappear under that layer when it is selected.

All layers are scaled to fit into the existing graph window. Rows are added until a the smallest square array is filled, at which point an additional column is added. Rows are then filled and additional rows added until the array is again square. For example, 2 layers results in a 1x2 array. 3 layers produces a 2x2 array with an empty space in the second row. 4 layers produces a full 2x2 array. Adding another layer will produce a 2x3 array, with one empty space in the second row. Additional layers result in more rows and columns being added to contain all the layers.</para>

<sect1 id="sec-data-menu">  <title>The Data Menu</title>
  <para>This menu is visible and active only when a graph window is selected. Commands in this menu will act
    on the plot/layer that is currently active in the graph window. All of these commands are switches - that is,
    they switch on an operational mode which remains in effect until it is canceled by selecting another
    command or by using the &pointer-cmd; command.</para>
  <sect2 id="pointer-cmd"><title>Data -> &pointer-cmd;</title>
    <para>For many of the remaining commands in this menu, &appname; will be locked into a special mode corresponding to that command, and that command's special pointer will be used instead of the normal pointer. This command is used to exit any of these special modes, returning &appname; to its normal mode and pointer behavior.</para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="zoom-inoutdrag-cmd"><title>Data -> &zoom-inoutdrag-cmd;&zoom-inoutdrag-key;</title>
    <para>Switches the active plot layer into a dynamic zoom/drag mode. Upon command execution, the default mode is "dynamic drag". To drag the plot, simply left click anywhere in the plotting area and drag the plot around with the mouse. Drop it at the new location by releasing the left mouse button. To zoom the plot, switch to dynamic zoom mode by first right clicking somewhere in the plot area. (This will probably pop-up a context menu that you should ignore.) Next, left click at a suitable zoom reference point in the plot area to enter dynamic zoom mode (this will also dismiss any pop-up menu). Once in dynamic zoom mode, scale the plot by moving the mouse cursor up to zoom out, or down to zoom in. Right and left mouse movements have no effect. You should use some foresight in picking the zoom reference point. For example, selecting a point at the bottom of the plot area will limit zooming to upward mouse travel - that is, you will only be able to zoom out. Once a suitable zoom factor has been found, left click anywhere in the plot to accept the zoom and return to dynamic drag mode.</para>
    <para>Note that the mouse wheel is always active when using this command. It can be used to zoom while in either dynamic drag or dynamic zoom modes. Also note that in either mode, zooming leaves the plot's aspect ratio unchanged.</para> 
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="zoom-draghoriz-cmd"><title>Data -> &zoom-draghoriz-cmd;&zoom-draghoriz-key;</title>
    <para>Switches the active plot layer into a dynamic zoom/drag mode which is limited to the horizontal direction. Upon command execution, the default mode is "dynamic horizontal drag". To drag the plot, simply left click anywhere in the plotting area and drag the plot to the right or left with the mouse. Drop it at the new location by releasing the left mouse button. Note that it may appear that you can move the plot up or down while dragging, but the original vertical location will be restored when the plot is dropped at the new horizontal location. To zoom the plot, switch to dynamic horizontal zoom mode by first right clicking somewhere in the plot area. (This will probably pop-up a context menu that you should ignore.) Next, left click at a suitable zoom reference point in the plot area to enter dynamic horizontal zoom mode (this will also dismiss any pop-up menu). Once in dynamic horizontal zoom mode, scale the plot's width by moving the mouse cursor up to zoom out, or down to zoom in. Right and left mouse movements have no effect. You should use some foresight in picking the zoom reference point. For example, selecting a point at the bottom of the plot area will limit zooming to upward mouse travel - that is, you will only be able to zoom out. Once a suitable zoom factor has been found, left click anywhere in the plot to accept the zoom and return to dynamic horizontal drag mode.</para>
    <para>Note that the mouse wheel is always active when using this command. It can be used to zoom while in either dynamic horizontal drag or dynamic horizontal zoom modes. Also note that in either horizontal mode, zooming will change the plot's aspect ratio.</para> 
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="zoom-dragvert-cmd"><title>Data -> &zoom-dragvert-cmd;&zoom-dragvert-key;</title>
    <para>Switches the active plot layer into a dynamic zoom/drag mode which is limited to the vertical direction. Upon command execution, the default mode is "dynamic vertical drag". To drag the plot, simply left click anywhere in the plotting area and drag the plot up or down with the mouse. Drop it at the new location by releasing the left mouse button. Note that it may appear that you can move the plot right or left while dragging, but the original horizontal location will be restored when the plot is dropped at the new vertical location. To zoom the plot, switch to dynamic vertical zoom mode by first right clicking somewhere in the plot area. (This will probably pop-up a context menu that you should ignore.) Next, left click at a suitable zoom reference point in the plot area to enter dynamic vertical zoom mode (this will also dismiss any pop-up menu). Once in dynamic vertical zoom mode, scale the plot's height by moving the mouse cursor up to zoom out, or down to zoom in. Right and left mouse movements have no effect. You should use some foresight in picking the zoom reference point. For example, selecting a point at the bottom of the plot area will limit zooming to upward mouse travel - that is, you will only be able to zoom out. Once a suitable zoom factor has been found, left click anywhere in the plot to accept the zoom and return to dynamic vertical drag mode.</para>
    <para>Note that the mouse wheel is always active when using this command. It can be used to zoom while in either dynamic vertical drag or dynamic vertical zoom modes. Also note that in either vertical mode, zooming will change the plot's aspect ratio.</para> 
  </sect2>

	<sect2 id="zoom-in-cmd"><title>Data -> &zoom-in-cmd; (&zoom-in-key;)</title>
    <para>Switches the active plot layer to zoom mode. The mouse cursor shape changes to a magnifying lens when it is inside a plot canvas. To zoom the plot, draw a box around a selected part of the plot by clicking at one corner of the desired box, dragging the mouse pointer to the opposite corner of the box and clicking a second time. The plot will be zoomed up such that the contents of the drawn box now fills the existing plotting area.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="zoom-out-cmd"><title>Data -> &zoom-out-cmd; (&zoom-out-key;)</title>
    <para>This command cancels a previous zoom operation. A zoom history is kept so that you can do multiple zoom out commands to step backwards through the zoom history. A separate zoom history is maintained for each plot layer. Executing this command does not set any special mode of its own but it will cancel any other special mode that is currently in effect (i.e., it performs an implicit &pointer-cmd; command).</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="rescale-cmd"><title>Data -> &rescale-cmd;  (&rescale-key;)</title>
    <para>Rescales the active plot layer after a zoom operation so that all data on the graph is visible. This command does not set any special mode of its own, but unlike the &zoom-out-cmd; command, it does not alter any other mode that may be in effect. Nevertheless, it does delete the zoom history of the rescaled plot.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="data-reader-cmd"><title>Data -> &data-reader-cmd; (&data-reader-key;)</title>
    <para>Shows a red cross cursor and opens the Data Display toolbar giving easy and quick access
    to the values of the data points. Select data points by moving the cursor with the Left
    and Right arrow keys or, more easily and quickly, by clicking on them with the mouse.
    Navigate through the curves on the plot layer with the Up and Down arrow keys.
    The [Home] key  makes the data reader jump to the beginning of the selected curve
    and the [End] key to its end point.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="select-data-range-cmd"><title>Data -> &select-data-range-cmd; (&select-data-range-key;)</title>
    <para>Shows two vertical line cursors that are used for selecting a data range when performing analysis operations. Only one cursor is active at a time. The active cursor is red, the other is black. You change which cursor is active with the Left and Right arrow keys. Move the active cursor with the arrows keys while keeping the Ctrl key pressed or, more easily and quickly, by clicking on a curve point. Note that the mouse cursor shape changes to a rectangular target while inside the active plot canvas. Navigate through the curves on the plot layer using the Up and Down arrow keys. When this tool is active you can easily copy, paste or cut the whole selected data range using the well-known shortcuts: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and Ctrl+X, respectively.</para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="screen-reader-cmd"><title>Data -> &screen-reader-cmd;</title>
    <para>Opens the Data Display toolbar and changes the mouse cursor shape to a small cross target. The coordinates
		of the cursor with respect to the axes of the active plot layer are displayed in a text field that floats along
		with the mouse cursor. Clicking the left mouse button at any point will draw a red crosshair at that point and
		copy the x and y coordinates of that point into the data display.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="draw-datapoints-cmd"><title>Data -> &draw-datapoints-cmd;</title>
    <para>This command is very similar to the &screen-reader-cmd; command but with the addition of the ability to add data points to a plot by double clicking at each of the desired points. Each invocation of this command will create a new table titled "DrawN", where N is an integer number that is incremented after each new table addition. These tables can be renamed and reformatted after creation using the standard window manipulation commands.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="move-data-points-cmd"><title>Data -> &move-data-points-cmd; (&move-data-points-key;)</title>
    <para>Allows modification of the position of data points on the active plot layer by simple drag-and-drop. When selecting this command, you will be asked to confirm that you understand that any changes you make will automatically modify the data in the corresponding tables (as well as all plots depending on that data). The coordinates of the cursor with respect to the axes of the plot layer are displayed in a text field that floats along with the mouse cursor. However, the Data Display toolbar is also opened to provide a higher resolution display the new coordinates. </para>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="remove-data-points-cmd"><title>Data -> &remove-data-points-cmd; (&remove-data-points-key;)</title>
    <para>Allows removal of data points from the active plot layer by double-clicking on them.  When selecting this command, you will be asked to confirm that you understand that any changes you make will also modify the data in the corresponding tables (as well as all plots depending on that data). The coordinates of the cursor with respect to the axes of the plot layer are displayed in a text field that floats along with the mouse cursor. The coordinates of all points selected for removal are shown in the Data Display toolbar.</para>
  </sect2>

<!--Added drag-curve command. SRB (09/22/2010 ) -->
  <sect2 id="drag-curve-cmd"><title>Data -> &drag-curve-cmd;</title>
    <para>Allows dragging an entire curve on the selected plot layer. Left Click and hold down the mouse button on any point on a curve to select the curve for dragging. A red cross-hair will be drawn at the point to indicate that the curve is selected. The curve may then be dragged around on the plot layer with the mouse as long as the left mouse button is held down. Releasing the mouse button will drop the curve at the new location. This process moves all the data points and changes the coordinates in the associated table. When selecting this command, you will be asked to confirm that you understand that dragging curves will modify the data in the corresponding tables (as well as all other plots depending on that data). The coordinates of the cursor with respect to the axes of the plot layer are displayed in a text field that floats along with the mouse cursor.</para>

<sect4 id="statistics-on-rows-cmd"><title>&statistics-on-rows-cmd;</title>
    <para>The &desc-stats-ptr;&statistics-on-rows-cmd; command creates a new table providing basic statistical information about the selected rows in the active table: average, variance, standard deviation, max value, etc. Prior to version 0.9.8.4, statistics were calculated on data in all columns in a selected row which contained numeric data of any kind, whether the column was visible or not. As of version 0.9.8.4, statistics are calculated only on numeric data in visible columns. Usually, statistics should be calculated on data of a similar type - Y values for example. This feature permits selection of only those columns that should be included in the statistical calculation.</para>
    <para>See the &statistics-on-columns-lnk; command for details on exactly what statistical values are calculated.</para>
</sect4>

<sect4 id="frequency-count-cmd"> <title>&frequency-count-cmd;</title>
    <para>The &desc-stats-ptr;&frequency-count-cmd; command calculates the frequency distribution of the data in the selected column. A dialog is popped up which allows selecting the data range and the bin width. The results are placed in a newly created table. This table will contain 4 columns with rows for each bin. These rows contain 1) the center value of the bin, the frequency (count) for the bin, the lower limit of the bin, and the cumulative frequency up to that bin. If more than one column is selected, an error dialog will pop-up.</para>

</sect3>

<sect3 id="normalize-cmd"><title>&normalize-cmd;</title>
    <para>These commands are used to normalize data in tables. In this case, normalization is the process of dividing each entry in the column by the column's maximum positive value, making the maximum range value equal to 1. Data is not re-centered so negative values will remain negative and the minimum value may be less than -1. Columns are normalized separately. The command does not create new columns for the normalized data but replaces the values in the selected columns with their normalized values. There are 2 variants of this command:</para>

      <sect4 id="normalize-column-cmd"><title>&normalize-column-cmd;</title>
	  <para>The &norm-ptr;&normalize-column-cmd; command normalizes only the selected column or columns. If you want the normalized data in a new column, use the &add-column-cmd; command to create a new column, fill it using a "copy/paste" sequence and then normalize the new column. </para>
      </sect4>

      <sect4 id="normalize-table-cmd"><title>&normalize-table-cmd;</title>
	  <para>The &norm-ptr;&normalize-table-cmd; command normalizes all the columns of the table. It is not a global normalization of all values of the table: each column is normalized separately.</para>

  <para>In most cases (except for integration), a new red curve is added to the active plot layer and a new table containing the data used to plot this curve is added to the workspace. Useful information about the operation performed will be shown in the Results Log display.</para>
  <para>The commands for the<link linkend="fft-cmd">&fft-cmd;</link> and <link linkend="non-linear-curve-fit-cmd">&non-linear-curve-fit-cmd;</link> are presented in the <link linkend="sec-analysis-menu-table">Table Analysis Menu</link>.</para>

<sect3 id="translate-cmd"><title>&translate-cmd;</title>
  <para>This next group of are 2 commands are used for translating curves horizontally and vertically.</para>
  <sect4 id="translate-vertical-cmd"><title>Vertical</title>
    <para>The Analysis -> &translate-vertical-cmd; command is used to move a curve in the vertical direction. When the command is selected, the cursor changes to a box and cross with an X-Y coordinate display which floats along with the cursor. You then select 2 points. The first must be a point on a curve. When the first points is selected, a crosshair will be drawn to indicate it's location. The second point can then be selected anywhere in the active graph region. The vertical distance between the selected points will be calculated, and the selected curve will be translated by this amount. The net result is to place the selected graph point at the new vertical location. Horizontal distance is ignored. This allows selection of the second point at one of the vertical axes, facilitating alignment of the selected graph point with some value on that axis. The second point may also be another curve point (either on the same or a different curve), a feature which makes it easy to align two or more curves in the vertical direction. <emphasis>Warning: </emphasis> the underlying curve's data is modified by this operation. No other warning will be given.</para>
  </sect4>
  <sect4 id="translate-horizontal-cmd"><title>Horizontal</title>
    <para>The Analysis -> &translate-horizontal-cmd; command is used to move a curve in the horizontal direction. When the command is selected, the cursor changes to a box and cross with an X-Y coordinate display which floats along with the cursor. You then select 2 points. The first must be a point on a curve. When the first points is selected, a crosshair will be drawn to indicate it's location. The second point then can be selected anywhere on the active graph region. The horizontal distance between the selected points will be calculated, and the curve will be translated horizontally by this amount. The net result is to place the selected graph point at the new location. Vertical distance is ignored. This allows selection of the second point at one of the horizontal axes, facilitating alignment of the selected graph point with some value on that axis. The second point may also be another curve point (either on the same or a different curve), a feature which makes it easy to align two or more curves in the horizontal direction. <emphasis>Warning: </emphasis> the underlying curve's data is modified by this operation. No other warning will be given.</para>

  <sect4 id="subtract-straight-line-cmd"><title>&subtract-straight-line-cmd;</title>
    <para>The Analysis &subtract-straight-line-cmd; command operates in a manner similar to the Analysis -> &subtract-baseline-lnk;. However, in this case, the two points which are selected define the end-points of a straight line which is subtracted from <emphasis>all </emphasis>the curves on the layer.The cursor changes to a cross target with an X-Y coordinate display which floats along with the cursor, similar to that used in the Analysis -> &subtract-baseline-lnk;. When the first point is selected, it will be marked with a small circle and crosshairs. As soon as the second point is selected, the line between the two points will be subtracted from the curves. <emphasis>Warning: </emphasis> the underlying curves' data is modified by this operation. No other warning will be given.</para>
  </sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>&differentiate-cmd;</title>
    <para>the Analysis -> &differentiate-cmd; command creates a new plot displaying the resulting curve of the numerical differentiation. The computation of the derivative is done by centered finite differences. A new table is created which contains one column for X-values and one column for derivatives of Y-values. It also creates a new plot of the derivative.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="integrate-curve-cmd"><title>&integrate-curve-cmd;</title>
    <para>the Analysis -> &integrate-curve-cmd; command performs a piecewise numerical integration of a curve on the selected layer. Curves are integrated using the trapezoidal rule. There must be at least one curve on the layer. If there are multiple curves, a dialog will be opened asking you to select which curve to use for the integration:</para>

<para> After selecting a curve, you may either proceed by clicking "OK" or abort with "Cancel". If there is only one curve on the layer, the integration is performed immediately upon selecting the &integrate-curve-cmd; command. A new Graph Window will be created containing a plot of the integrated curve, the data for which is stored in a new (hidden) table. </para>
</sect3>
<!--************************************************************************** -->

<sect3 id="integrate-function-cmd"><title>&integrate-function-cmd;</title>
    <para>The Analysis -> &integrate-function-cmd; command provides the capability of performing the numerical integration of a user defined function. The <link linkend="integrate-function-dialog">Function Integration dialog</link> is opened when this command is executed.  This dialog provides for the definition of the function, the variable of integration, and the parameters that control the integration. Integration is performed using the QAGS algorithm from the GNU Scientific Library. For many functions, all you need do is set the limits of integration and click the "Integrate" button. The default values for the other parameters will usually produce excellent results. For some functions, especially those containing singularities and discontinuities, you may need to experiment with the number of sub-intervals and the tolerance limit to obtain acceptable results. However, a detailed discussion of the use of these 2 parameters is beyond the scope of this manual. If the <emphasis>Plot Area </emphasis> option is checked, a curve of the integrated function will be added to the currently active layer. In any case, an entry is made in the <link linkend="sec-intro-log-window">Log Panel</link> which contains the numerical result of the computed definite integral over the specified interval.</para>

<sect3 id="smooth-cmd"><title>&smooth-cmd;</title><para>There are 4 variants of the &smooth-cmd; menu item:</para>
    
<!--************************************************************************** -->
  <sect4 id="savitsky-golay-cmd"><title>Savitski-Golay</title>
	  <para>The Analysis -> &savitsky-golay-cmd; command performs a smoothing of the selected curve using the Savitzky-Golay method. The formula used to smooth the curve defined by the points y<subscript>i</subscript>=f(x<subscript>i</subscript>) is:</para>

	  <para>The f<subscript>i</subscript> values are computed by fitting the data points to a polynomial. They depend on the number of points used for the smoothing of the curve and the order of the polynomial. Compared to the moving window average method, the advantage of this smoothing method is that the values of extrema are not truncated. The dialog allows specification of the curve which will be smoothed, the order of the polynomial, the number of data points used for the polynomial fit before and after each point, and the color used to draw the smoothed curved. A new table will be created to store the data points x<subscript>i</subscript>, z<subscript>i</subscript>.</para>

   <sect4 id="lowess-cmd"><title>Lowess...</title>
	  <para>The Analysis -> &lowess-cmd; command performs a smoothing of the selected curve using the Lowess (aka Loess) algorithm.
      It provides a  robust locally weighted regression and is well suited to smooth data for which no
      formal model exists.</para>
    <para>The parameter <emphasis>f</emphasis> is the fraction of points which define the local neighborhood.
      A value of 0.2 uses 20% of the curve total points as neighbors for each data point (+/- 10%).
      Values of <emphasis>f</emphasis> closer to 1 yield smoother curves.
      The <emphasis>iterations</emphasis> parameter specifies the number of times to run the algorithm runs over the entire data set,
      each time refining the local weights. In most cases, two iterations will be sufficient.</para>

	<para>Matrix smoothing is performed by shrinking and then expanding the matrix using bilinear interpolation.
If the number of columns or rows is less than 32, the matrix is first expanded so that the row number and the column number are both twice of the original.
Then the expanded matrix is shrunk to the original size.
Through this process of expanding and shrinking, the size of the output matrix will be exactly the same as the original matrix. However, the data will be much smoother.
If both the number of columns and the number of rows in the original matrix are greater than 31, the matrix is first shrunk and then expanded to obtain the smoothed matrix.
